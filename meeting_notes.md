# RGI Meeting notes


## October23rd 2020 "Road to RGI" group wide meeting.

Notes are on [google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nxbCDiMGz04B8yN_gHR49w1rptSk7ye5YUipUQMpPh8/edit?usp=sharing)

## October 9th 2020 WG meeting preparation (telecon)

### Participants

Steering committee 

### Agenda

- Lay out a "roadmap to RGI7"
- Agree on responsibilities: 
    - Frank and Philipp will "create the RGI", based on GLIMS/Bruce "RGI on demand". Then the datasets as decided in the Table and WG wide meeting will be copy pasted in it 
    - Fabien will generate the "RGI on demand" using GLIMS API
    - Fabien will do the first quality checks and add attributes (e.g. DEMs)
    - Beta version will be checked by community
- More infos on the mail drafted to community


## August 18th 2020 New outlines submission meeting (telecon)

### Participants

Steering committee 

### 1. Subregion + Region discussion

- Bruce’s notes about the topic is on google docs 
- Changing the files online is some work (DOIs, more than one repository to update, documentation, etc.), but OK. The implementation is more complex.
- Long discussion about the current regions / subregions. Decisions: 
    - we make the smallest changes that are needed but don’t touch the “problem” regions like HMA.
    - Caucasus will be changed to incorporate missing glaciers in the South
    - Greenland will get new SUBregions with published outlines. Ask to Greenland research community if OK 
    - A border in South America will be moved a tiny bit in order not to cross a glacier complex. 
    - Have a note on the technical document about the changes and how to determine membership to a region (with centroid) 
    - Zürich will produce the final shapefile in iteration with Bruce and Fabien 
    - For the future: can we have an idea about how many subregions / regions are NOT following valley bottoms?

### 2. RGI Outlines discussion

- Frank & Philipp prepared a table + presentation about the current situation and a suggestion about the changes to make. Looking very good, but possibly some elements are still missing because the “RGI-on-demand” button might uncover other potential datasets. Decision: 
    - Bruce uses the RGI-on-demand feature and provides the results to Frank & Philipp for assessment. 
    - Frank & Philipp prepare a slightly updated document with more text explaining what this is about. 
    - The steering committee shortly assesses if this is ready to go
    - We organize an RGI-wide meeting first half of September to discuss and accept the working document

### 3. Other infos

- Michael:
    - NSIDC project with Ann Windnagel: find the biggest complexes for each region: found some errors in GLIMS/RGI which will be reported.
    - Romain Huguonnet’s global geodetic dataset is in review: discussions about how to share the data: aggregated series will be in Pangea, the Geodetic MBs at WGMS, but the full DEMs still in discussion.
    - Goal: mass-change time-series based on that dataset are in preparation
- Frank:
    - EU project: start working on a “LIA RGI”.


## July 27th 2020 RGI meeting (telecon)

### Participants

Steering committee 

### Agenda draft

- Regions file need update:
    - Caucasus glaciers not fully in a region boundary
    - Some glacier outlines across boundaries -> little tweaks but no big change for political reasons
    - Add level 2 regions for some regions, mostly Greenland
    - Obstacle: GTN-G regions have to agree
- Bruce:
    - All dev work has been moved from test to production (almost there at time of call)
    - Caveats: 
        - because of boundary issues not all glaciers are selected 
        - Format of RGI-on-demand data still not 1-to-1 with normal GLIMS downloads
- Frank:
    - Still working on getting data from various groups 
    - 9 datasets needed from Bruce, only two available atm
    - Alps: 2000 to 2003 diffs are small - sometimes the quality is less than 2003 because of bad scenes. Frank: not replace existing data (main argument: metadata with 60 scenes against 6 scenes for the 2003 data). Debate if these arguments are strong enough. Define and use the “decision matrix” with factors.
    - Northern Ellesmere Islands: outlines similar but ice divides very different - RGI seems more reasonable though and outlines same year, but very strange artifacts in the new data.
    - Next steps:
        - More datasets needed from Bruce to Frank
        - Philipp volunteers for the (confusion) decision matrix
        - New data submissions:  N. Ellesmere Island data have been ingested into GLIMS (for 1999, 2005, and 2015).



## July 6th 2020 "GLIMS freeze" RGI meeting (telecon)

### Participants

Steering committee 

### Notes 

- Outlines list Bruce are not in GLIMS yet (Alps, Prince William Sound glaciers, Argentina inventory are ingested recently)
- Availabilities over the summer:
    - Bruce is around 
    - Frank is around
    - Philipp is around - mid-september baby coming 
    - Regine is around (Oslo from 1 September on)
    - Fabien: one week afk August
- RGI on demand feature: alpha version was on server since a couple of months ago. Number of reported issues fixed. Current version on test server -> to be moved on the production server. Ingesting new outlines can be pretty quick. 
- Frank:
    - Plan A: use the RGI on demand feature - testing is going to decide how this works
    - Plan B: “Data integration” below. RGI6 as baseline, and replace the RGI6 outlines as submitted by the various groups (cut and paste). Caveat: attributes will be different. Advantage: easier maybe, given the number of datasets that need replaced.
    - Plan C: “RGI extraction tool” based on year + submission ID
    - No matter how we do: the datasets need to be in GLIMS for copyright issues. Once the decision is more or less done, the list of criteria can be decided upon
- Bruce:
    - Button is in good shape - where it does not work nicely probably a human will have issues as well (e.g. Patagonia and ice divides)
    - “Outlines working group” will meet again and discuss the details. 
- More discussions
    - Naming of RGI7 -> how to do with multitemporal versions. RGI2000 v7?
    - Sam Herreid data -> Frank writes to him

## April 14th 2020 (telecon)

### Participants

RGI Steering committee 

### Agenda draft

- RGI on demand alpha-release: 
    - first reviews are coming in
    - 5th of May call
    - revised timeline 
- Organisation of first WG call with all members (All):
    - Organise call for action - here the work for us is to engage and motivate the group:
        - See the agenda draft on google docs
        - RGI-on-demand testing and choice of outlines. Ideally, we want a smaller task force to be created for this (too many people detrimental)
        - RGItools and related tools: call for contribution and ideas
        - Organisation of a forum / issue tracker for community feedback regaring RGI6 and future betas of RGI7: see https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgi_issue_tracker

- AGU session? RAGMAG + RGI + GTNG from Bruce 
- Any other business?


## March 6th 2020 (telecon)

### Participants

Regine Hock, Fabien Maussion (late), Philipp Rastner, Bruce Raup, Frank Paul

Not present: Michael Zemp

### Agenda 

- Decide on the constitution of the working group
    - discussion about the members/contributors application
    - discussion about unclear cases - final list is now ready to be communicated
    - set up of a list of criteria that have to be clearly communicated to all as to what defines a "member" and a "contributor"
- Status of "RGI on demand" button
    - some issues with overlapping polygons that needed to be solved
    - beta release by April if everything goes well

### Action items 

- Regine: will draft an email to all applicant

- Frank: sends an email for the wide RGI meeting at EGU (or rather at the same time as planned in EGU, but probably telecon)
- Fabien: find a format for sharing info in an open manner.
    - I've opened a github repository for now, other suggestions welcome: https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI/rgidocs 

## January 9th 2020 (Zürich)


### Participants

Regine, Michi, Frank, Philipp, Matthias, Fabien, Bruce (remotely from 4 pm)

### Agenda

- Status of the proposal
    - Proposal is still in final review. Some key points need to be clarified by IACS Bureau, in particular wrt to GLIMS in the title or not. We will wait for IACS suggestion, and if they insist we can suggest the following subtitle: “Towards the automatic derivation of multi-temporal RGI products from the GLIMS database”.
- Finalize the call for contributions:
    - Most discussion was about the conditions for participation. Following the examples of other WGs, we now define “WG members” and “WG contributors”. See draft email below (looking good as is, in my opinion) 
- RGI-TOPO beta release
    - Fabien and Matthias made a demo. See https://rgitools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dems.html . Some small updates are necessary but we will send this out to CRYOLIST soon.
- RGI version 7 timeline
    - We have a lot of work ahead of us! But the meeting was very motivating, and there is a clear path forward.
    - See attached [Gantt chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZYFcPyYySrXSOf0mmv6zPWlntn91VUzO-OVgOA0Pb6E/edit?usp=sharing)
    - Most urgent milestones and responsible persons:
        - Call for data (Michi, Frank, Philipp, Paul): email to be sent to CRYOLIST after the “call for participation” from Fabien and Regine (i.e. right after WG approval)
        - “RGI-on-demand” button in beta-testing version (Bruce) (Feb 1st)
- Communication and outreach
    - Abstract for EGU2020
        - Fabien will write and submit a poster abstract to the “Glaciers from space” session
    - Website(s) and communication platforms.
        - We keep and update the current web presence: 
            - glims.org (Bruce has credentials) 
            - iacs.org (Regine has credentials)
            - We opened a new GLIMS-RGI github organisation. See https://github.com/GLIMS-RGI 


## November 6th 2019 (telecon)

### Participants

Michael Zemp, Regine Hock, Fabien Maussion, Philipp Rastner, Bruce Raup, Matthias Dusch

Not present: Frank Paul

### Agenda

1. WG title
    - After some discussion, we agreed on: "IACS Working Group on the Randolph Glacier Inventory and its role in future glacier monitoring."
2. Issues with diversity and group membership. How to move forward?
    - We agreed to keep the steering commitee as it is because it reflects the engagement of all members up to now. We change Michael's affiliation. 
    - We make some changes in the text about future membership and make clear that the "steering" comittee is here to "steer", not make aritrary decisions.
3. Task forces 
    - in the proposal we are now committing ourselves to do a certain work. I kind of made those "task forces" myself, so I would like to hear your views about it, and especially know if you are OK with committing to this.
    - Add a new task force to make it clear that generating the RGI is going to imply human decision (and some level of arbitrary). The steering commitee will have to do that.
4. Next steps
    - Submit ASAP. Start to work already, because "in one way or another", it will be accepted. 
    - Fabien will merge all the comments in the text and "wrap-it-up", send out for final review and submit early next week.
    - Suggested reviewers:
        - Pierre Pitte (Mendoza, Argentina): pierrepitte@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar 
        - Thorsten Seehaus (Erlangen, Germany): thorsten.seehaus@fau.de
        - Jon Ove Hagen (Oslo, Norway): j.o.m.hagen@geo.uio.no
        - Akiko Sakai (Nagoya University): shakai@nagoya-u.jp
        - Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir (Iceland): gua@hi.is
        - Adina Racoviteanu (Aberystwyth, UK): adr18@aber.ac.uk

    - New RGI has to be delivered within 18 months in order to meet Copernicus deadline.
5. Any other business?
    - We agreed on a "in site" meeting in Zürich, Jan 9 afternoon (for Innsbruck to be continued on 10)
6. Status of DEM work. 
    - Advancing well! Thanks Matthias for all the work. Summary here: https://hackmd.io/kZ808zYwTlKZbdamrx1AtA
