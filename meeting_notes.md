### Agenda

1. WG title
2. Issues with diversity and group membership. How to move forward?
3. Task forces: in the proposal we are now committing ourselves to do a certain work. I kind of made those "task forces" myself, so I would like to hear your views about it, and especially know if you are OK with committing to this.
4. Next steps.
5. Any other business?
6. Status of DEM work. Matthias has made progress with the "DEM for any glacier" task, and I would like to shortly present our plan for the next steps (licensing, beta version, community input)


### 1. Title 

After some discussion, we agreed on:

"IACS Working Group on the Randolph Glacier Inventory and its role in future glacier monitoring."

### 2. WG Membership

We agreed to keep the steering commitee as it is because it reflects the engagement of all members up to now. We change Michael's affiliation. 

We make some changes in the text about future membership and make clear that the "steering" comittee is here to "steer", not make aritrary decisions.


### 3. Task force

Add a new task force to make it clear that generating the RGI is going to imply human decision (and some level of arbitrary). The steering commitee will have to do that.


### 4. Next steps

Submit ASAP. Start to work already, because "in one way or another", it will be accepted. 

Fabien will merge all the comments in the text and "wrap-it-up", send out for final review and submit early next week.

Suggested reviewers:
- Pierre Pitte (Mendoza, Argentina): pierrepitte@mendoza-conicet.gob.ar 
- Thorsten Seehaus (Erlangen, Germany): thorsten.seehaus@fau.de
- Jon Ove Hagen (Oslo, Norway): j.o.m.hagen@geo.uio.no

- Guðfinna Aðalgeirsdóttir (Iceland): gua@hi.is
- Adina Racoviteanu (Aberystwyth, UK): adr18@aber.ac.uk

New RGI has to be delivered within 18 months in order to meet Copernicus deadline.

### 5. Other business

We agreed on a "in site" meeting in Zürich, Jan 9 afternoon (for Innsbruck to be continued on 10).

### 6. Status of DEM work

Advancing well! Thanks Matthias for all the work. Summary here: https://hackmd.io/kZ808zYwTlKZbdamrx1AtA
